# 🚀 Railway PORT Variable Fix

## ✅ **Issue Identified and Fixed!**

**Problem**: `Error: '$PORT' is not a valid port number.`

**Root Cause**: The `$PORT` environment variable was not being properly expanded in the Docker CMD command. Railway provides the PORT as an environment variable, but the shell wasn't expanding it correctly.

## 🛠️ **Solution Applied**

### Fixed Dockerfile.backend:
1. **Created a startup script** that properly handles the `$PORT` environment variable
2. **Used bash shell** to ensure proper variable expansion
3. **Maintained JSON array format** for CMD to prevent signal issues
4. **Added fallback port** (5001) if PORT is not set

### Key Changes:
```dockerfile
# Create startup script to handle PORT variable
RUN echo '#!/bin/bash\nexec gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:${PORT:-5001} --workers 2 --timeout 120 --access-logfile - --error-logfile - app:app' > /app/start.sh && \
    chmod +x /app/start.sh

# Start the application using the startup script
CMD ["/app/start.sh"]
```

## 🚀 **Deploy the Fix**

### 1. Commit and Push:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway PORT variable expansion issue - use startup script"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Railway will automatically redeploy

### 3. Expected Success:
- ✅ Container starts without PORT errors
- ✅ Gunicorn binds to Railway's provided port
- ✅ Health check passes at `/api/health`
- ✅ API endpoints become accessible

## 🔍 **What This Fix Does**

### Before (Broken):
```dockerfile
CMD ["sh", "-c", "gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:${PORT:-5001} ..."]
```
- Shell couldn't properly expand `$PORT` in JSON array format
- Railway's PORT value wasn't being used
- Gunicorn received literal string `$PORT` instead of port number

### After (Fixed):
```dockerfile
RUN echo '#!/bin/bash\nexec gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:${PORT:-5001} ...' > /app/start.sh
CMD ["/app/start.sh"]
```
- Bash script properly expands `${PORT:-5001}`
- Uses Railway's PORT value when available
- Falls back to 5001 for local development
- Gunicorn receives actual port number

## 📊 **Expected Railway Logs**

After the fix, you should see:
```
Starting Container
[INFO] Starting gunicorn 20.1.0
[INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:XXXX (1)
[INFO] Using worker: sync
[INFO] Booting worker with pid: XX
Database connection successful
Health check passed: /api/health returned 200
```

## 🎯 **Why This Happened**

Railway provides environment variables at runtime, but Docker's JSON array CMD format doesn't perform shell expansion. The startup script approach ensures:

1. **Proper Variable Expansion**: Bash handles `${PORT:-5001}` correctly
2. **Railway Compatibility**: Works with Railway's dynamic port assignment
3. **Local Development**: Falls back to port 5001 when PORT isn't set
4. **Security**: Maintains non-root user execution

## ✅ **Verification Steps**

After deployment:
1. **Check Railway logs** - should show gunicorn starting on correct port
2. **Test health endpoint**: `https://your-app.railway.app/api/health`
3. **Test API endpoints**: `https://your-app.railway.app/api/designers`
4. **Verify admin interface**: `https://your-app.railway.app/`

This fix should resolve the health check failures and get your Railway deployment working! 🎉
